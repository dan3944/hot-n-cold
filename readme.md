# Hot + Cold

Have you ever used traditional navigation systems and just thought to yourself, “This is way too easy!” They tell you where you are, where you’re going, and precisely how to get there. How can we make this mundane process more exciting?

With Hot + Cold, we combine the fun of getting lost with the joy of arriving at your destination.

This cutting-edge navigational paradigm only needs a point-of-interest category and maximum travel distance to get you off on your way to discovering new places. You navigate the streets nearly blind, with no knowledge of your destination, but Hot + Cold delivers subtle suggestions based on the age-old warmer and colder cues. The color hue even changes as you complete your journey, allowing you to be sure of your intuition.

Hot + Cold also takes the tedious process of decision making out of the equation. We’ve all used apps to help us select a restaurant, but how useful can they be when you can just reject every option as soon as it’s suggested? Hot + Cold carefully selects an open destination in your vicinity, and you can’t say no without first putting in the effort to get there.
